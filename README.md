## ⚠️ CLASSIFIED ARCHIVES DATABASE ⚠️

Welcome to the **NULL: Mystery Organisation** secure web portal. This repository contains our organization's complete digital infrastructure for documenting unexplained phenomena, government conspiracies, and classified incidents.

**NULL: Mystery Organisation** ~ *Probably the worst guarded website on the internet.*

Our organization has been tracking anomalies since 1947. This web platform represents decades of classified research, leaked documents, and anonymous testimonies. We've spared no expense on our website infrastructure—which is to say, we've spent approximately $47 and several hours of ChatGPT prompting.

## 🔓 Security Notice

Our cybersecurity team (Jim, who also does accounting) has assured us that this website is "pretty much unhackable" and "definitely more secure than his home WiFi." 

All sensitive data is protected by military-grade... well, it's protected by *something*. We think. Jim said he "copied some code from Stack Overflow" and "it should be fine."

**Fun fact:** We've been breached 47 times this month. It's only the 16th.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (Jim says this is important)
npm install

# Launch the portal
npm start

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Pro tip: All our passwords are stored in plaintext for "easy recovery"
```

## 📁 What's Inside?

- **Case Files Archive** - Hundreds of documented anomalies and unexplained incidents
- **Donation System** - Support our cause (and exploit our payment processing)
- **Inner Circle Membership** - Exclusive access to ~~the same files~~ premium content
- **Agent Login** - We definitely check passwords properly (we don't)
- **Hacker Training Guide** - A comprehensive guide... to hacking us

## 🎯 For Security Researchers

This website is **intentionally vulnerable** for educational purposes. Think of it as a playground where every possible security mistake has been lovingly implemented.

We've created this as a training platform for learning about web vulnerabilities, penetration testing, and ethical hacking. Every OWASP Top 10 vulnerability is present—and we've thrown in some extras for good measure.

**Key Features:**
- SQL Injection (because prepared statements are hard)
- XSS (we love displaying user input without sanitization)
- IDOR (access anyone's data—we won't notice)
- Authentication bypasses (passwords are really just suggestions)
- SSRF, XXE, Command Injection, and many more!

---

## 🎓 Educational Use

**This is for learning, not attacking real systems.**

✅ **Do:** Learn about vulnerabilities, practice ethical hacking, build security skills  
❌ **Don't:** Use these techniques on real websites without permission

Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal. This platform exists in a safe, controlled environment specifically for education.

## 🐛 Known Issues

Jim tried to fix some bugs last week but accidentally introduced 15 new ones. We've decided to embrace this as a "feature-rich learning experience."

**Current Status:**
- Authentication: Bypassed
- Database: Exposed
- File System: Accessible
- Environment Variables: Publicly available
- Admin Panel: No authentication required
- Backup Files: Downloaded 1,247 times today

---

## 🔐 Installation Guide

**Requirements:**
- Node.js (version... any version, probably)
- npm (Jim thinks it stands for "Node Package Magic")
- A computer (Jim's words: "one that turns on")

**Setup:**

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/4fqr/nullmysteryorg.git
cd nullmysteryorg

# Install all the things
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

**Docker Deployment** (for the fancy people):

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Jim hasn't actually tested the Docker setup. He says "it should work theoretically."

## 📚 Learning Path

1. **Start at the homepage** - Look around, click things
2. **Try the login form** - Your first SQL injection awaits
3. **Explore the API** - Every endpoint is a treasure trove
4. **Read the Hacker Guide** - Hints about what's broken
5. **Find the secret pages** - There are hidden pages everywhere
6. **Challenge yourself** - Can you achieve RCE? Read /etc/passwd?

## 🏆 Hall of Shame (Contributors)

- **Jim** - Lead Developer & Security Officer
  - "I once read a blog post about SSL"
  - Favorite password: `password123`
  
- **Agent X** - Database Administrator
  - Stores all passwords in plaintext "for debugging"
  - Once committed `.env` to GitHub (twice)

- **Shadow** - Frontend Designer
  - Believes XSS stands for "Xtra Special Styling"
  - Uses `eval()` for "performance"

---

## ⚡ Features

- **100+ Vulnerabilities** - We've achieved the impossible: breaking everything
- **Cinematic UI** - Matrix rain effects, glitch animations, cyber aesthetics
- **Real-world Patterns** - Not CTF tricks—actual vulnerable code you'll see in the wild
- **Comprehensive Documentation** - Hidden in various places (good luck finding it all)
- **Secret Pages** - Because security through obscurity totally works

## 💀 Default Credentials

```
admin@null.org / s3cr3t_p4ss!
shadow@null.org / password123
agentx@null.org / 123456
```

**Note:** These are the same passwords everyone uses. Including Jim.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

**DO NOT deploy this to a public server.** 

This is for local use only. If you deploy this publicly, you'll get hacked faster than Jim can say "but it worked on my machine!"

**Localhost only. Always.**

---

## 📞 Support

If you find a vulnerability, that's... kind of the point. Congratulations!

If the site breaks in an unintended way, Jim promises to look at it "when he gets a chance" (translation: never).

**Disclaimer:** This project is satire meets education. NULL: Mystery Organisation is fictional. The vulnerabilities are real. Jim is not real (probably).

---

## 🎪 Final Words

This website represents everything wrong with web security—deliberately packaged as a learning tool. We've combined terrible security practices with a conspiracy theory aesthetic to create the ultimate training ground.

**Remember:**
- Never use these techniques on real websites without permission
- Ethical hacking only
- Always get authorization before testing security
- Jim is a cautionary tale, not a role model

**Have fun, learn lots, and please be better than Jim.**
